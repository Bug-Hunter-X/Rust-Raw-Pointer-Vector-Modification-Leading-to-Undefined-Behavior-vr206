This repository contains a demonstration of a potential undefined behavior bug in Rust when modifying a vector using a raw pointer. The `bug.rs` file showcases the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.rs` presents a safer alternative using safe Rust methods.  The bug arises from the unsafe manipulation of the vector's internal representation. Modifying the vector directly through the raw pointer bypasses Rust's safety checks, potentially leading to memory corruption or panics. The solution demonstrates how to avoid such issues using safe Rust techniques.
